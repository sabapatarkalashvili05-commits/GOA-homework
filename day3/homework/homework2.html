<p>my favourite car is bmw m3 (also known as xuliganka) The BMW M3 first appeared in 1986 (E30) as the sports version of the 3 Series.
Since then, several generations have come out — E36, E46, E92, F80, and G80.
The M3 is known for its powerful engine, loud sound, and aggressive driving, which is why its often called “Xuliganka” (the hooligan).
This car became a symbol of speed, power, and freedom — the true king of the streets.</p>
